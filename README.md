# The very small P.O.O.P assignment

This is a very small assignment to get acquainted a little bit with how Object Oriented Programming in Python works 
with usage of the DND API as resource.

## Installation
Version of Python should be newer than 3.8 (and supported). Your OS of choice to run the code is perferably Linux, Mac or WSL2.
TLDR; Clone the repo, make a virtenv and make sure that you have the Requests library in it. Or on Linux, install the package accordingly. 

Long explanation:
```bash
  git clone git@github.com:cdorsman/oop-dnd.git
```
Change into project directory
```bash
  cd oop-dnd
```
Create a virtualenv and activate(in Linux and Mac)
```bash
  python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate 
```
Install Requests Python library 
```bash
  pip install requests
```
Or Debian:
```bash
  sudo apt install python3-requests
```
    
## Where can I find the assignment? 
You can find the assignment in assignment.txt

Good luck!
