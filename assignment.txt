Welcome to the very small OOP in Python course 

Do the following:
- Open assignment.py in your favorit editor
- In the file you see functions 'display_spells' and 'menu'

Now the challenge for you is:
- Make a class SpellBook with a constructor with one argument: spells=dict
- Add a property 'spells' that makes use of 'spells'
- Make the functions 'display_spells' and 'menu' menthods
- Fix your new menu method that makes use of your spells property and display_spells menthods 
- Make a 'main' function where you do the following:
  - Make a instance of DNDAPI and SpellBook
  - class SpellBook should be fed with DNDAPI.spells
  - Execute (your_instance_name).menu method

  You should be getting a nice menu.
  
Good luck!

PS: There is a solution file. BUT! 
It wouldn't be fun if you don't try it yourself first.
